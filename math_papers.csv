0,Generalized Bassian and other Mixed Abelian Groups with Bounded p-Torsion,2023-08-01 16:13:57+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00641v1,"It is known that a mixed abelian group G with torsion T is Bassian if, and
only if, it has finite torsion-free rank and has finite p-torsion (i.e., each
Tp is finite). It is also known that if G is generalized Bassian, then each pTp
is finite, so that G has bounded p-torsion. To further describe the generalized
Bassian groups, we start by characterizing the groups in some important classes
of mixed groups with bounded p-torsion (e.g., the balanced-projective groups
and the Warfield groups). We then prove that all generalized Bassian groups
must have finite torsion-free rank, thus answering a question recently posed in
Acta Math. Hung. (2022) by Chekhlov-Danchev-Goldsmith. This implies that every
generalized Bassian group must be a B+E-group; i.e., the direct sum of a
Bassian group and an elementary group. The converse is shown to hold for a
large class of mixed groups, including the Warfield groups. It is also proved
that G is a B+E-group if, and only if, it is a subgroup of a generalized
Bassian group.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00641v1
1,Imposing nonlocal boundary conditions in Galerkin-type methods based on non-interpolatory functions,2023-08-01 15:14:50+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00595v1,"The imposition of inhomogeneous Dirichlet (essential) boundary conditions is
a fundamental challenge in the application of Galerkin-type methods based on
non-interpolatory functions, i.e., functions which do not possess the Kronecker
delta property. Such functions typically are used in various meshfree methods,
as well as methods based on the isogeometric paradigm. The present paper
analyses a model problem consisting of the Poisson equation subject to
non-standard boundary conditions. Namely, instead of classical boundary
conditions, the model problem involves Dirichlet- and Neumann-type nonlocal
boundary conditions. Variational formulations with strongly and weakly imposed
inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type nonlocal conditions are derived and compared
within an extensive numerical study in the isogeometric framework based on
non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The attention in the numerical study is
paid mainly to the influence of the nonlocal boundary conditions on the
properties of the considered discretisation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00595v1
2,An operator-asymptotic approach to periodic homogenization applied to equations of linearized elasticity,2023-08-01 15:11:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00594v1,"We explain an operator-asymptotic approach to homogenization for periodic

thin elastic plates with rapidly oscillating periodic properties. J. London

approach under the simpler setting of equations of linearized elasticity. As a
consequence, we obtain $L^2\to L^2$, $L^2\to H^1$, and higher order $L^2\to
L^2$ norm-resolvent estimates. The correctors for the $L^2\to H^1$, and higher
order $L^2\to L^2$ results are constructed from boundary value problems that
arise during the asymptotic procedure, and the first-order corrector is shown
to coincide with classical formulae.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00594v1
3,SelfCheck: Using LLMs to Zero-Shot Check Their Own Step-by-Step Reasoning,2023-08-01 10:31:36+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00436v1,"The recent progress in large language models (LLMs), especially the invention
of chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting, makes it possible to solve reasoning
problems. However, even the strongest LLMs are still struggling with more
complicated problems that require non-linear thinking and multi-step reasoning.
In this work, we explore whether LLMs have the ability to recognize their own
errors, without resorting to external resources. In particular, we investigate
whether they can be used to identify individual errors within a step-by-step
reasoning. To this end, we propose a zero-shot verification scheme to recognize
such errors. We then use this verification scheme to improve question-answering
performance, by using it to perform weighted voting on different generated
answers. We test the method on three math datasets-GSM8K, MathQA, and MATH-and
find that it successfully recognizes errors and, in turn, increases final
predictive performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00436v1

5,On higher multiplicity hyperplane and polynomial covers for symmetry preserving subsets of the hypercube,2023-07-31 17:47:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16881v1,"Alon and F\""uredi (European J. Combin. 1993) gave a tight bound for the
following hyperplane covering problem: find the minimum number of hyperplanes
required to cover all points of the n-dimensional hypercube {0,1}^n except the
origin. Their proof is among the early instances of the polynomial method,
which considers a natural polynomial (a product of linear factors) associated
to the hyperplane arrangement, and gives a lower bound on its degree, whilst
being oblivious to the (product) structure of the polynomial. Thus, their proof
gives a lower bound for a weaker polynomial covering problem, and it turns out
that this bound is tight for the stronger hyperplane covering problem.
  In a similar vein, solutions to some other hyperplane covering problems were
obtained, via solutions of corresponding weaker polynomial covering problems,
in some special cases in the works of the fourth author (Electron. J. Combin.
2022), and the first three authors (Discrete Math. 2023). In this work, we
build on these and solve a hyperplane covering problem for general symmetric
sets of the hypercube, where we consider hyperplane covers with higher
multiplicities. We see that even in this generality, it is enough to solve the
corresponding polynomial covering problem. Further, this seems to be the limit
of this approach as far as covering symmetry preserving subsets of the
hypercube is concerned. We gather evidence for this by considering the class of
blockwise symmetric sets of the hypercube (which is a strictly larger class
than symmetric sets), and note that the same proof technique seems to only
solve the polynomial covering problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16881v1

hypersurfaces, that is, the umbilic-free Euclidean hypersurfaces $f\colon
M^n\to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that admit non-trivial deformations preserving the
Moebius metric. For $n\geq 5$, the classification was completed by the authors
in \cite{JT2}. In this article we obtain an infinitesimal version of that
classification. Namely, we introduce the notion of an infinitesimal Moebius
variation of an umbilic-free immersion $f\colon M^n\to \mathbb{R}^m$ into
Euclidean space as a one-parameter family of immersions $f_t\colon M^n\to
\mathbb{R}^m$, with $t\in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ and $f_0=f$, such that the
Moebius metrics determined by $f_t$ coincide up to the first order. Then we
characterize isometric immersions $f\colon M^n\to \mathbb{R}^m$ of arbitrary
codimension that admit a non-trivial infinitesimal Moebius variation among
those that admit a non-trivial conformal infinitesimal variation, and use such
characterization to classify the umbilic-free Euclidean hypersurfaces of
dimension $n\geq 5$ that admit non-trivial infinitesimal Moebius variations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16341v1

We derive explicit forms of functions characterizing relaxation phenomena in
the time domain - the relaxation, response and probability distribution
functions. We also explain how to construct and solve relevant evolution
equations within these models. These equations are usually solved by using the
Schwinger parametrization and the integral transforms. Instead, in this work we
replace it by the powerful Efros theorem. That allows one to relate physically
admissible solutions to the memory-dependent evolution equations with
phenomenologically known spectral functions and, from the other side, with the
subordination mechanism emerging from a stochastic analysis of processes
underpinning considered relaxation phenomena. Our approach is based on a
systematic analysis of the memory-dependent evolution equations. It exploits
methods of integral transforms, operational calculus and special functions
theory with the completely monotone and Bernstein functions. Merging analytic
and stochastic methods enables us to give a complete classification of the
standard functions used to describe the large class of the relaxation phenomena

conservation laws are stiff, and thus impose a very small time-step because of
the restrictive CFL stability condition. In this case, one can exploit the
superior stability properties of implicit time integration which allows to
choose the time-step only from accuracy requirements, and thus avoid the use of
small time-steps. We discuss an efficient framework to devise high order
implicit schemes for stiff hyperbolic systems without tailoring it to a
specific problem. The nonlinearity of high order schemes, due to space- and
time-limiting procedures which control nonphysical oscillations, makes the
implicit time integration difficult, e.g.~because the discrete system is
nonlinear also on linear problems. This nonlinearity of the scheme is
circumvented as proposed in (Puppo et al., Comm.~Appl.~Math.~\& Comput., 2023)
for scalar conservation laws, where a first order implicit predictor is
computed to freeze the nonlinear coefficients of the essentially
non-oscillatory space reconstruction, and also to achieve limiting in time. In
addition, we propose a novel conservative flux-based a-posteriori time-limiting
procedure using numerical entropy indicators to detect troubled cells. The
numerical tests involve classical and artificially devised stiff problems using

several diverse tasks: 1) math problems, 2) sensitive/dangerous questions, 3)
opinion surveys, 4) multi-hop knowledge-intensive questions, 5) generating
code, 6) US Medical License tests, and 7) visual reasoning. We find that the
performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time.
For example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs.
composite numbers (84% accuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these same
questions (51% accuracy). This is partly explained by a drop in GPT-4's amenity
to follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 was much better in
June than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to answer sensitive
questions and opinion survey questions in June than in March. GPT-4 performed
better at multi-hop questions in June than in March, while GPT-3.5's
performance dropped on this task. Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting
mistakes in code generation in June than in March. Overall, our findings show

GRAPE method for optimizing objective functionals for open quantum systems

PDEs named as Keller-Segel (KS) and Patlak-Keller-Segel (PKS) systems were
proposed in 1970s. Since KS and PKS systems possess relatively simple
structures but admit rich dynamics, plenty of scholars have studied them and
obtained many significant results. However, the cells in general direct their
movement in liquid. As a consequence, it seems more realistic to consider the
influence of ambient fluid flow on the chemotactic mechanism.
  Motivated by this, He et al. (SIAM J. Math. Anal., Vol. 53, No. 3, 2021)
proposed a coupled Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system that features the
effect of the friction induced by the cells on the ambient fluid flow. In their
pioneer work, the global existence of solutions of such system in 2D was
established when the initial mass is strictly less than a threshold, which is
referred to as the subcritical case. The last two authors and Zhou (Indiana
Univ. Math. J., Vol. 72, No. 1, 2023) extended their result to the critical
case. To our best knowledge, this system has only been studied in either the
whole space or periodic domains.
  In this paper, we consider the chemotaxis-fluid system in two-dimensional
bounded domains, in which the boundary conditions are Neumann conditions for
the cell density and the chemical concentration, and the Navier slip boundary
condition with zero friction for the fluid velocity. We prove that the solution
of the system exists globally in time with the subcritical mass. Concerning the
critical mass case, we construct the boundary spot equilibrium rigorously via
the inner-outer gluing method.
  In particular, we develop the global $W^{2,p}$ theory for the 2D stationary
Stokes system subject to Navier boundary conditions and further establish
semigroup estimates of the nonstationary counterpart by analyzing the Stokes
eigenvalue problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08295v3

two-sided Kazhdan--Lusztig cell, making it a categorification of the asymptotic
algebra (J-ring), and that the categorical center of this ""asymptotic Hecke
category"" is equivalent to the category of unipotent character sheaves
supported in the cell. Subsequently, Lusztig noted that an asymptotic Hecke
category can be constructed for any finite Coxeter group using Soergel
bimodules. Lusztig conjectured that the centers of these categories are modular
tensor categories (which was then proven by Elias and Williamson) and that for
non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups the S-matrices coincide with the
Fourier matrices that were constructed in the 1990s by Lusztig, Malle, and
Brou\'e--Malle. If the conjecture is true, the centers may be considered as
categories of ""unipotent character sheaves"" for non-crystallographic finite
Coxeter groups.
  In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for dihedral groups and
for some (we cannot resolve all) cells of H3 and H4. The key ingredient is the
method of H-reduction and the identification of the (reduced) asymptotic Hecke
category with known categories whose center is already known as well. We
conclude by studying the asymptotic Hecke category and its center for some

students' attitudes to mathematics, reduce the incidence of maths anxiety and
prepare students for topics normally introduced at more senior levels. The
program entitled Maths for Einstein's Universe includes five modules covering
extreme numbers, estimation, probability, vectors and curved space geometry

school teachers. Analysis of knowledge and attitude tests and questionnaires
from about 170 participants demonstrate strong student enthusiasm and positive
learning outcomes in areas normally considered beyond the ability of students

series are given by $N$-variate symmetric polynomials. The spectral problem in
question consists in the decomposition of the characters after their
restriction to the subgroups of the same type but smaller rank $K<N$. The main
result of the paper is the derivation of explicit determinantal formulas for
the coefficients in this decomposition.
  In fact, we first compute these coefficients in a greater generality -- for
the multivariate symmetric Jacobi polynomials depending on two continuous
parameters. Next, we show that the formulas can be drastically simplified for
the three special cases of Jacobi polynomials corresponding to the $C$-$B$-$D$
characters. In particular, we show that then the coefficients are given by
piecewise polynomial functions. This is where a link with discrete splines
arises.

conditioned on the event $\{ \tau_u < \infty \}$, $\frac{\tau_u}{\log u}$
converges in probability to a certain constant $\rho > 0$ as $u \to \infty$. A
conditioned central limit theorem for $\tau_u$ is also obtained. We further
establish precise large deviation asymptotics for the lower probability

  In this note we show the result even more generally: over every semigroup

some applications of this inequality over such $\mathscr{G}$, extending Banach

setting of generality for $\mathscr{G}$ subsumes not only semigroups with
bi-invariant metric (thus extending the previously shown results), but it also

left-invariant Riemannian metric).
  We also explain why this primitive setting of strongly left/right-invariant

Previously we developed the cognitive framework describing proficiency in MSS

dominant backgrounds (White, middle class) using assessment built around PhET
simulations. In this study we investigate whether the framework can
characterize engagement in MSS among undergraduate students from diverse
backgrounds and identify potential differences between the two populations. The
framework is effective in characterizing engagement in MSS by undergraduate
students from diverse backgrounds and largely functions as a learning
progression. We have also uncovered a distinct pattern of engagement in MSS
reflected in students successfully developing the mathematical relationship
describing their observations without engaging in a type of MSS focused on
quantitative pattern identification. Unlike students from dominant backgrounds,
diverse students leverage lower level MSS to develop the formula for the
phenomenon. Further, diverse students use PhET simulations to make sense of the
phenomenon more and are more successful in using the simulations to find the
correct mathematical relationship compared to students from dominant
backgrounds. Math preparation has a stronger effect at level 1 compared to
levels 2 and 3 of the framework. The framework can guide the development of
instructional and assessment strategies to support students from diverse

f(S)\chi_S$ in terms of norms of $f$. If $f$ is Boolean-valued, the level-$d$
inequality allows bounding the norm of $f^{=d}=\sum_{|S|=d}\hat f(S)\chi_S$ in
terms of $E[f]$. These two inequalities play a central role in analysis of
Boolean functions and its applications.
  While both inequalities hold in a sharp form when the hypercube is endowed
with the uniform measure, they do not hold for more general discrete product
spaces. Finding a `natural' generalization was a long-standing open problem. In
[P. Keevash et al., Global hypercontractivity and its applications, J. Amer.

presented, that holds for functions which are `global' -- namely, are not
significantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. This
hypercontractive inequality is not sharp, which precludes applications to the
symmetric group $S_n$ and to other settings where sharpness of the bound is
crucial. Also, no level-$d$ inequality for global functions over general
discrete product spaces is known.
  We obtain sharp versions of the hypercontractive inequality and of the

diverse applications to extremal set theory and to group theory. We demonstrate
this by proving quantitative bounds on the size of intersecting families of

another open problem proposed by F. Hamel and N. Nadirashvili in the same

using proof assistants such as Lean. However, existing methods are difficult to
reproduce or build on, due to private code, data, and large compute
requirements. This has created substantial barriers to research on machine
learning methods for theorem proving. This paper removes these barriers by
introducing LeanDojo: an open-source Lean playground consisting of toolkits,
data, models, and benchmarks. LeanDojo extracts data from Lean and enables
interaction with the proof environment programmatically. It contains
fine-grained annotations of premises in proofs, providing valuable data for
premise selection: a key bottleneck in theorem proving. Using this data, we
develop ReProver (Retrieval-Augmented Prover): the first LLM-based prover that
is augmented with retrieval for selecting premises from a vast math library. It
is inexpensive and needs only one GPU week of training. Our retriever leverages
LeanDojo's program analysis capability to identify accessible premises and hard
negative examples, which makes retrieval much more effective. Furthermore, we
construct a new benchmark consisting of 96,962 theorems and proofs extracted
from Lean's math library. It features challenging data split requiring the
prover to generalize to theorems relying on novel premises that are never used
in training. We use this benchmark for training and evaluation, and
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ReProver over
non-retrieval baselines and GPT-4. We thus provide the first set of open-source

area to specialize in, such as theory, computation, or experiment. Often
students develop preferences and dislikes, but it's unclear when this
preference solidifies during their undergraduate experiences. To get a better
understanding, we interviewed eighteen physics majors who were at different
stages of their degree regarding their interest in theory, computation, and
experimental methods. Out of the eighteen students, we chose to analyze only
nine students who rated computation and theory the lowest. Our analysis did not
include interest in experiment because the ratings were less negative. We used
Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Lucidchart to analyze students'
responses and create individual graphical representations of the influences for
each student. Through this, we uncovered how various factors such as learning
experiences, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations influenced their low
interest in a particular method. We found that lack of knowledge and experience
is often the main reason why self-efficacy was lower. Students' lack of
interest is also influenced by negative outcome expectations (e.g,
math-intensive and a bad work-life balance) more than other SCCT factors. Our
findings could help physics departments and educators identify positive and
negative factors that could lead to a more motivating and inclusive physics

Qualitative analysis methods are powerful in uncovering domain-specific

progress with the success of deep neural networks (DNN), but it is far from
being solved. We argue that the ability of learning by analogy is essential for
an MWP solver to better understand same problems which may typically be
formulated in diverse ways. However most existing works exploit the shortcut
learning to train MWP solvers simply based on samples with a single question.
In lack of diverse questions, these methods merely learn shallow heuristics. In
this paper, we make a first attempt to solve MWPs by generating diverse yet
consistent questions/equations. Given a typical MWP including the scenario
description, question, and equation (i.e., answer), we first generate multiple
consistent equations via a group of heuristic rules. We then feed them to a
question generator together with the scenario to obtain the corresponding
diverse questions, forming a new MWP with a variety of questions and equations.
Finally we engage a data filter to remove those unreasonable MWPs, keeping the
high-quality augmented ones. To evaluate the ability of learning by analogy for
an MWP solver, we generate a new MWP dataset (called DiverseMath23K) with
diverse questions by extending the current benchmark Math23K. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can generate
high-quality diverse questions with corresponding equations, further leading to
performance improvement on Diverse-Math23K. The code and dataset is available

As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an
optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by
dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there
seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and
implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary
attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network
model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the
Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same
objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an
ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain,
under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated
coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents
a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained

providing responses to questions on subjects including exponential and
logarithmic functions, geometric progression, and arithmetic progression. The
study found that ChatGPT had difficulty correctly answering questions on topics
including derivatives and applications, spatial geometry, and Oxyz spatial
calculus. Additionally, this study contrasted ChatGPT outcomes with Vietnamese

Statistics, the GRE Quantitative, AMC 10, AMC 12, and AP Calculus BC. These

with monochromatic components of bounded size. The number of colours is best
possible regardless of the size of monochromatic components. It solves an open
problem of Edwards, Kang, Kim, Oum and Seymour [\emph{SIAM J. Disc. Math.}

unclear if these models possess accurate representations of mathematical

2017], using the H\""{o}rmander symbol classes $S^m_{\rho, \delta}(G)$
introduced in [Progress in Mathematics, 314. Birkh\""{a}user/Springer, 2016]. We
particularly focus on the so-called symmetric calculi, for which quantizing and
taking the adjoint commute, among them the Euclidean Weyl calculus, but we also
recover the (non-symmetric) Kohn-Nirenberg calculus, on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on
general graded groups [Progress in Mathematics, 314. Birkh\""{a}user/Springer,
2016]. Several interesting applications follow directly from our calculus:
expected mapping properties on Sobolev spaces, the existence of one-sided
parametrices and the G\r{a}rding inequality for elliptic operators, and a
generalization of the Poisson bracket for symmetric quantizations on stratified
groups.
  In the particular case of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_n$, we are able to
answer the fundamental questions of this paper: which, among all the admissible
quantizations, is the natural Weyl quantization on $\mathbb{H}_n$? And which
are the criteria that determine it uniquely? The surprisingly simple but
compelling answers raise the question whether what is true for $\mathbb{R}^n$
and $\mathbb{H}_n$ also extends to general graded groups, which we answer in
the affirmative in this paper.
  Among other things, we discuss and investigate an analogue of the symplectic
invariance property of the Weyl quantization in the setting of graded groups,

stratified groups, linking it to the symbolic properties of the commutators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04275v1

phosphor layer in their place. This procedure results in a detector capable of
imaging positron beams with energies down to a few tens of eV, or an intensity

eliciting more student reasoning. We recruit expert math teachers to evaluate
the zero-shot performance of ChatGPT on each of these tasks for elementary math

management of liver transplant patients is centered around immunosuppressive
multidrug regimens. Current research has been focusing on phenotypic
personalized medicine as a novel approach in the optimization of
immunosuppression, a regressional math modeling focusing on individual patient
dose and response using specific markers like transaminases. A prospective area
of study includes the development of a mechanistic computational math modeling

long-term graft survival by exploring the intricate immune/drug interactions to
help us further our understanding and management of medical problems like
transplants, autoimmunity, and cancer therapy. Thus, by increasing long-term
graft survival, the need for redo transplants will decrease, which will free up
organs and potentially help with the organ shortage problem promoting equity
and equal opportunity for transplants, as well as decreasing the medical costs
associated with additional testing and hospital admissions. Although long-term
graft survival remains challenging, computational and quantitative methods have
led to significant improvements. In this article, we review recent advances and

appropriate algorithms or methods for its solution; and Generate a coherent
response and a correct answer. We use 30 questions that are clear, without any
ambiguities, fully described with plain text only, and have a unique, well
defined correct answer. The questions are divided into two sets of 15 each. The
questions of Set A are 15 ""Original"" problems that cannot be found online,
while Set B contains 15 ""Published"" problems that one can find online, usually
with their solution. Each question is posed three times to each chatbot. The
answers are recorded and discussed, highlighting their strengths and
weaknesses. It has been found that for straightforward arithmetic, algebraic
expressions, or basic logic puzzles, chatbots may provide accurate solutions,

made through scoring their final answers based on correctness. It was found
that ChatGPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 in both sets of questions. Bard comes
third in the original questions of Set A, behind the other two chatbots, while
it has the best performance (first place) in the published questions of Set B.

perspectives on learning outcomes (LOs) to facilitate the integration of LOs

target is undergraduate (adult) learners but these LOs can be adapted for
earlier and later stages of learning. Core contents of Ethical Reasoning are:
1. its six constituent knowledge, skills, and abilities; 2. a stakeholder
analysis; and 3. ethical practice standards or guidelines. These are briefly
summarized. Five LOs are articulated at each of three levels of cognitive
complexity (low/med/high), and a set of assignment features that can be adapted
repeatedly over a term are given supporting these LOs. These features can
support authentic development of the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are
the target of ethical reasoning instruction in math and quantitative courses at
the tertiary level. Three contexts by which these can be integrated are
Assumption (what if the assumption fails?), Approximation (what if the
approximation does not hold?), and Application (is the application appropriate?
what if it is not?). One or more of the three core contents of Ethical
Reasoning can be added to any problem already utilized in a course (or new

effective in numerous natural language processing tasks, but designing prompts
that generalize well to diverse problem types can be challenging, especially in
the context of math word problem (MWP) solving. Additionally, it is common to
have a large amount of training data that have a better diversity coverage but
CoT annotations are not available, which limits the use of supervised learning
techniques. To address these issues, we investigate two approaches to leverage
the training data in a few-shot prompting scenario: dynamic program prompting
and program distillation. Our approach is largely inspired by Gao et al.,
(2022), where they proposed to replace the CoT with the programs as the
intermediate reasoning step. Such a prompting strategy allows us to accurately
verify the answer correctness through program execution in MWP solving. Our
dynamic program prompting involves annotating the training data by sampling
correct programs from a large language model, while program distillation
involves adapting a smaller model to the program-annotated training data. Our
experiments on three standard MWP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
these approaches, yielding significant improvements over previous baselines for
prompting and fine-tuning. Our results suggest that leveraging a large amount
of training data can improve the generalization ability of prompts and boost
the performance of fine-tuned small models in MWP solving.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18170v2

defined on single graphs which may be dense or sparse, directed or undirected,

networks depending on multiple graphs, and extend his results to show that the
continuum limit is also valid in this situation. Specifically, we prove that
the initial value problem (IVP) of the corresponding continuum limit has a
unique solution under general conditions and that the solution becomes the
limit of those to the IVP of the networks in some adequate meaning. Moreover,
we show that if solutions to the networks are stable or asymptotically stable
when the node number is sufficiently large, then so are the corresponding
solutions to the continuum limit, and that if solutions to the continuum limit
are asymptotically stable, then so are the corresponding solutions to the
networks in some weak meaning as the node number tends to infinity. These
results can also be applied to coupled oscillator networks with multiple

operations preserving determinantal inequalities in this class. We introduce
set row/column operations that act directly on all determinantal inequalities
for TN matrices, and yield further inequalities for these matrices. These
operations assist in revealing novel additive inequalities for TN matrices
embedded in the classical identities due to Laplace $[$Mem$.$ Acad$.$ Sciences

behind CoT and how it unlocks the potential of LLMs remain elusive. In this
paper, we take a first step towards theoretically answering these questions.
Specifically, we examine the expressivity of LLMs with CoT in solving
fundamental mathematical and decision-making problems. We start by giving an
impossibility result showing that bounded-depth Transformers are unable to
directly produce correct answers for basic arithmetic/equation tasks unless the
model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In
contrast, we then prove by construction that autoregressive Transformers of
constant size suffice to solve both tasks by generating CoT derivations using a
commonly-used math language format. Moreover, we show LLMs with CoT are capable
of solving a general class of decision-making problems known as Dynamic
Programming, thus justifying its power in tackling complex real-world tasks.
Finally, extensive experiments on four tasks show that, while Transformers
always fail to predict the answers directly, they can consistently learn to
generate correct solutions step-by-step given sufficient CoT demonstrations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15408v3

especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g.,
Chain-of-Thought, CoT). However, LLMs can still struggle with problems that are
easy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given
environment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning.
The deficiency stems from the key fact that LLMs lack an internal
$\textit{world model}$ to predict the world $\textit{state}$ (e.g., environment
status, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of
actions. This prevents LLMs from performing deliberate planning akin to human
brains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating
future states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps.
To overcome the limitations, we propose a new LLM reasoning framework,
$\underline{R}\textit{easoning vi}\underline{a} \underline{P}\textit{lanning}$
$\textbf{(RAP)}$. RAP repurposes the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning
agent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo
Tree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During
reasoning, the LLM (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the
guidance of the LLM (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a
high-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between
exploration $\textit{vs.}$ exploitation. We apply RAP to a variety of
challenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and
logical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority
of RAP over various strong baselines, including CoT and least-to-most prompting

self-consistency and verifiers rely on sampling from the LM distribution and do
not tackle the underlying issue. To address this, we introduce Guiding
Multi-step ReAsoning with a CorrectnEss Discriminator (GRACE), a stepwise
decoding approach that nudges the model towards producing correct reasoning
steps. GRACE employs a discriminator model, which is trained to differentiate
correct steps from invalid ones, to adjust decoding preferences based on the
correctness of each reasoning step. Importantly, GRACE does not require
fine-tuning or re-training the LMs. When compared with conventional decoding
strategies over four popular math reasoning benchmarks, GRACE exhibits

it also occur over the course of training? We carry out an exploratory study
investigating whether, over the course of training on the language modeling
task, the performance of language models at specific tasks can decrease while
general performance remains high. We find that for two tasks from the Inverse
Scaling Challenge - quote-repetition and redefine-math - this is indeed the
case. Specifically, we find that for Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) models with
a higher number of parameters, performance decreases over the course of
training at these two tasks, despite these models showing standard (positive)
scaling overall. This highlights the importance of testing model performance at
all relevant benchmarks any time they are trained on additional data, even if
their overall performance improves.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14681v1

scholarly reading interfaces and scholarly information extraction (IE).
However, the task poses several challenges: math symbols are difficult to
process as they are not composed of natural language morphemes; and scholarly
papers often contain sentences that require resolving complex coordinate
structures. We present SymDef, an English language dataset of 5,927 sentences
from full-text scientific papers where each sentence is annotated with all
mathematical symbols linked with their corresponding definitions. This dataset
focuses specifically on complex coordination structures such as ""respectively""
constructions, which often contain overlapping definition spans. We also
introduce a new definition extraction method that masks mathematical symbols,
creates a copy of each sentence for each symbol, specifies a target symbol, and
predicts its corresponding definition spans using slot filling. Our experiments
show that our definition extraction model significantly outperforms RoBERTa and
other strong IE baseline systems by 10.9 points with a macro F1 score of 84.82.
With our dataset and model, we can detect complex definitions in scholarly

parsimonious math equations. Automatically distilling these equations from

grand challenge. Keen efforts in recent years have been placed on tackling this
issue and demonstrated success in symbolic regression. However, there still
exist bottlenecks that current methods struggle to break when the discrete
search space tends toward infinity and especially when the underlying math
formula is intricate. To this end, we propose a novel Reinforcement Symbolic
Regression Machine (RSRM) that masters the capability of uncovering complex
math equations from only scarce data. The RSRM model is composed of three key
modules: (1) a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) agent that explores optimal math
expression trees consisting of pre-defined math operators and variables, (2) a
Double Q-learning block that helps reduce the feasible search space of MCTS via
properly understanding the distribution of reward, and (3) a modulated sub-tree
discovery block that heuristically learns and defines new math operators to
improve representation ability of math expression trees. Biding of these
modules yields the state-of-the-art performance of RSRM in symbolic regression
as demonstrated by multiple sets of benchmark examples. The RSRM model shows
clear superiority over several representative baseline models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14656v1

personalized and more accessible, research on such systems has been hampered by
a lack of sufficiently large and high-quality datasets. However, collecting
such datasets remains challenging, as recording tutoring sessions raises
privacy concerns and crowdsourcing leads to insufficient data quality. To
address this problem, we propose a framework to semi-synthetically generate
such dialogues by pairing real teachers with a large language model (LLM)
scaffolded to represent common student errors. In this paper, we describe our
ongoing efforts to use this framework to collect MathDial, a dataset of
currently ca. 1.5k tutoring dialogues grounded in multi-step math word
problems. We show that our dataset exhibits rich pedagogical properties,
focusing on guiding students using sense-making questions to let them explore
problems. Moreover, we outline that MathDial and its grounding annotations can
be used to finetune language models to be more effective tutors (and not just
solvers) and highlight remaining challenges that need to be addressed by the
research community. We will release our dataset publicly to foster research in
this socially important area of NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14536v1

perform specific tasks. One effective prompting method is in-context learning,
where the model performs a (possibly new) generation/prediction task given one
(or more) examples. Past work has shown that the choice of examples can make a
large impact on task performance. However, finding good examples is not
straightforward since the definition of a representative group of examples can
vary greatly depending on the task. While there are many existing methods for
selecting in-context examples, they generally score examples independently,
ignoring the dependency between them and the order in which they are provided
to the large language model. In this work, we propose Retrieval for In-Context
Learning (RetICL), a learnable method for modeling and optimally selecting
examples sequentially for in-context learning. We frame the problem of
sequential example selection as a Markov decision process, design an example
retriever model using an LSTM, and train it using proximal policy optimization
(PPO). We validate RetICL on math problem solving datasets and show that it
outperforms both heuristic and learnable baselines, and achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on the TabMWP dataset. We also use case studies to
show that RetICL implicitly learns representations of math problem solving

Our starting point is a variant of the well-known endpoint Fefferman-Stein
inequality for the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. This inequality
generalizes, in the hyperbolic setting, the weak $(1,1)$ estimates obtained by
Str\""omberg in ""Weak type L1 estimates for maximal functions on noncompact
symmetric spaces"", Ann. of Math. 114 (1981), where Str\""omberg answered a
question posed by Stein and Wainger in ""Problems in harmonic analysis related
to curvature"", Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 84 (1978). Our approach is based on a
combination of geometrical arguments and the techniques used in the discrete
setting of regular trees by Naor and Tao in ""Random martingales and
localization of maximal inequalities"", J. Funct. Anal. 259 (2010). This variant
of the Fefferman-Stein inequality paves the road to weighted estimates for the
maximal function for $p>1$. On the one hand, we show that the classical $A_p$
conditions are not the right ones in this setting. On the other hand, we
provide sharp sufficient conditions for weighted weak and strong type $(p,p)$
boundedness of the centered maximal function, when $p>1$. The sharpness is in
the sense that, given $p>1$, we can construct a weight satisfying our
sufficient condition for that $p$, and so it satisfies the weak type $(p,p)$
inequality, but the strong type $(p,p)$ inequality fails. In particular, the
weak type $(q,q)$ fails as well for every $q < p$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14473v1

the chain-of-thought~(CoT) reasoning as multi-turn conversations, to utilize
tools in a more natural way through chatting. At each turn, LLMs can either
interact with tools or perform the reasoning. Our approach can effectively

the thought chain following and tools manipulation in a unified way. Specially,
we initialize the early turns of the conversation by the tools, tasks and

CREATOR, a novel framework that empowers LLMs to create their own tools through
documentation and code realization. CREATOR disentangles the LLM's ability into
two distinct phases: abstract tool creation and concrete decision execution,
which results in improved LLM performance. We evaluate CREATOR on two
established benchmarks: MATH, which consists of challenging math competition
problems, and TabMWP, which includes diverse tabular contents for
problem-solving. Remarkably, CREATOR significantly outperforms existing
chain-of-thought (CoT), program-of-thought (PoT), and tool-using baselines on
these two benchmarks. Additionally, we present a new dataset, Creation
Challenge, comprising 2K diverse questions, to highlight the necessity and
benefits of LLMs' tool creation ability in effectively addressing these

particles in a viscous liquid in current applied research. In this paper we
assume the particles are convex with arbitrary shapes and mainly investigate
the interaction between the rigid particles and the domain boundary when the
distance tends to zero. In fact, even though the domain and the prescribed
boundary data are both smooth, it is possible to cause a definite increase of
the blow-up rate of the stress. This problem has the free boundary value
feature due to the rigidity assumption on the particle. We find that the
prescribed local boundary data directly affects on the free boundary value on
the particle. Two kinds of boundary data are considered: locally constant
boundary data and locally polynomial boundary data. For the former we prove the
free boundary value is close to the prescribed constant, while for the latter
we show the influence on the blow-up rate from the order of growth of the
prescribed polynomial. Based on pointwise upper bounds in the neck region and
lower bounds at the midpoint of the shortest line between the particle and the

optimal. These precise estimates will help us understand the underlying

probes deeper into their understanding of the subject. Specifically, we
formulate a new task where given a question, the LLM can generate a correct
solution while the user believes in a wrong solution in the beginning, and they
need to discuss to make the correct decision through dialogue. Such a setting
requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own (which could
be done by shallow memorization), but also be able to defend the truth instead
of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and
critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of
the reasoning required to solve the problem. To automate this evaluation
framework and save human labor, we simulate the user using another LLM
conditioned on a synthesized wrong solution. Across a range of complex
reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and tasks from
BIG-Bench, we find that despite being able to generate correct step-by-step

Hence, it is important to understand the biases present in their outputs in

methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs
act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are
prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is
the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. Here, we
investigate perceptions of math and STEM fields provided by cutting-edge
language models, namely GPT-3, Chat-GPT, and GPT-4, by applying an approach
from network science and cognitive psychology. Specifically, we use behavioral
forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM

three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to
humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have an overall negative perception of
math and STEM fields, with math being perceived most negatively. We observe
significant differences across the three LLMs. We observe that newer versions
(i.e. GPT-4) produce richer, more complex perceptions as well as less negative
perceptions compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These
findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to

completely upgraded with a new pixel vertex detector, a silicon tracker
upstream of the dipole magnet and three scintillating fibre tracking stations
downstream of the magnet. The whole photon detection system of the RICH
detectors has been renewed and the readout electronics of the calorimeter and
muon systems have been fully overhauled. The first stage of the all-software
trigger is implemented on a GPU farm. The output of the trigger provides a
combination of totally reconstructed physics objects, such as tracks and
vertices, ready for final analysis, and of entire events which need further
offline reprocessing. This scheme required a complete revision of the computing

197,A quantitative study of NLP approaches to question difficulty estimation,2023-05-17 14:26:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10236v1,"Recent years witnessed an increase in the amount of research on the task of
Question Difficulty Estimation from Text QDET with Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques, with the goal of targeting the limitations of traditional
approaches to question calibration. However, almost the entirety of previous
research focused on single silos, without performing quantitative comparisons
between different models or across datasets from different educational domains.
In this work, we aim at filling this gap, by quantitatively analyzing several
approaches proposed in previous research, and comparing their performance on
three publicly available real world datasets containing questions of different
types from different educational domains. Specifically, we consider reading
comprehension Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), science MCQs, and math
questions. We find that Transformer based models are the best performing across
different educational domains, with DistilBERT performing almost as well as
BERT, and that they outperform other approaches even on smaller datasets. As
for the other models, the hybrid ones often outperform the ones based on a
single type of features, the ones based on linguistic features perform well on
reading comprehension questions, while frequency based features (TF-IDF) and
word embeddings (word2vec) perform better in domain knowledge assessment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10236v1

motivated by the desire to expand LLM performance to the learning of
non-linguistic notions (numerals, and subsequently, arithmetic reasoning).
However, non-linguistic skill injection typically comes at a cost for LLMs: it
leads to catastrophic forgetting of core linguistic skills, a consequence that
often remains unaddressed in the literature. As Math-NLP has been able to
create LLMs that can closely approximate the mathematical skills of a
grade-schooler or the arithmetic reasoning skills of a calculator, the
practicality of these models fail if they concomitantly shed their linguistic
capabilities. In this work, we take a closer look into the phenomena of
catastrophic forgetting as it pertains to LLMs and subsequently offer a novel
framework for non-linguistic skill injection for LLMs based on information
theoretic interventions and skill-specific losses that enable the learning of
strict arithmetic reasoning. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art both on

prominent progress in code intelligence. However, existing code LLMs have two
main limitations in terms of architecture and pretraining tasks. First, they
often adopt a specific architecture (encoder-only or decoder-only) or rely on a
unified encoder-decoder network for different downstream tasks. The former
paradigm is limited by inflexibility in applications while in the latter, the
model is treated as a single system for all tasks, leading to suboptimal
performance on a subset of tasks. Secondly, they often employ a limited set of
pretraining objectives which might not be relevant to some downstream tasks and
hence result in substantial performance degrade. To address these limitations,
we propose ``CodeT5+'', a family of encoder-decoder LLMs for code in which
component modules can be flexibly combined to suit a wide range of downstream
code tasks. Such flexibility is enabled by our proposed mixture of pretraining
objectives to mitigate the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. These objectives
cover span denoising, contrastive learning, text-code matching, and causal LM
pretraining tasks, on both unimodal and bimodal multilingual code corpora.
Furthermore, we propose to initialize CodeT5+ with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs
without training from scratch to efficiently scale up our models, and explore
instruction-tuning to align with natural language instructions. We extensively
evaluate CodeT5+ on over 20 code-related benchmarks in different settings,
including zero-shot, finetuning, and instruction-tuning. We observe
state-of-the-art (SoTA) model performance on various code-related tasks, such
as code generation and completion, math programming, and text-to-code retrieval

continuum model. The huddle boundary evolves due to heat loss to the huddle
exterior and through the reorganisation of penguins as they seek to regulate
their heat production within the huddle. These two heat transfer mechanisms,
along with area, or penguin number, conservation, gives a free boundary problem
whose dynamics depend on both the dynamics interior and exterior to the huddle.
Assuming the huddle shape evolves slowly compared to the advective timescale of
the exterior wind, the interior temperature is governed by a Poisson equation
and the exterior temperature by the steady advection-diffusion equation. The
exterior, advective wind velocity is the gradient of a harmonic, scalar field.
The conformal invariance of the exterior governing equations is used to convert
the system to a Polubarinova-Galin type equation, with forcing depending on
both the interior and exterior temperature gradients at the huddle boundary.
The interior Poisson equation is not conformally invariant, so the interior
temperature gradient is found numerically using a combined adaptive
Antoulas-Anderson and least squares algorithm. The results show that,
irrespective of the starting shape, penguin huddles evolve into an egg-like
steady shape. This shape is dependent on the wind strength, parameterised by
the P\'eclet number Pe, and a parameter \b{eta} which effectively measures the
strength of the interior self-generation of heat by the penguins. The numerical
method developed is applicable to a further five free boundary problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07324v1

generalizes the classic $k$-Median, $k$-Means, and $k$-Center problems. Given a
constant $z\ge 1$, the input to Robust $(k, z)$-Clustering is a set $P$ of $n$
weighted points in a metric space $(M,\delta)$ and a positive integer $k$.
Further, each point belongs to one (or more) of the $m$ many different groups
$S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_m$. Our goal is to find a set $X$ of $k$ centers such that
$\max_{i \in [m]} \sum_{p \in S_i} w(p) \delta(p,X)^z$ is minimized.
  This problem arises in the domains of robust optimization [Anthony, Goyal,
Gupta, Nagarajan, Math. Oper. Res. 2010] and in algorithmic fairness. For
polynomial time computation, an approximation factor of $O(\log m/\log\log m)$
is known [Makarychev, Vakilian, COLT $2021$], which is tight under a plausible
complexity assumption even in the line metrics. For FPT time, there is a
$(3^z+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which is tight under GAP-ETH [Goyal,
Jaiswal, Inf. Proc. Letters, 2023].
  Motivated by the tight lower bounds for general discrete metrics, we focus on
\emph{geometric} spaces such as the (discrete) high-dimensional Euclidean
setting and metrics of low doubling dimension, which play an important role in
data analysis applications. First, for a universal constant $\eta_0 >0.0006$,
we devise a $3^z(1-\eta_{0})$-factor FPT approximation algorithm for discrete
high-dimensional Euclidean spaces thereby bypassing the lower bound for general
metrics. We complement this result by showing that even the special case of
$k$-Center in dimension $\Theta(\log n)$ is $(\sqrt{3/2}- o(1))$-hard to
approximate for FPT algorithms. Finally, we complete the FPT approximation

systems can cause catastrophic real-world damage by infecting device binaries

tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical
operations in the code. Conventional reverse engineering tools can decompile
binaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This paper
proposes REMaQE, an automated framework for reverse engineering of math
equations from binary executables. REMaQE uses symbolic execution for dynamic
analysis of the binary to extract the relevant semantic knowledge of the
implemented algorithms. REMaQE provides an automatic parameter analysis pass
which also leverages symbolic execution to identify input, output, and constant
parameters of the implemented math equations. REMaQE automatically handles
parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and
supports reverse engineering of object-oriented implementations such as C++
classes. REMaQE uses an algebraic simplification method which allows it to
scale to complex conditional equations with ease. These features make REMaQE
stand out over existing reverse engineering approaches for math equations. On a
dataset of randomly generated math equations compiled to binaries from C and
Simulink implementations, REMaQE accurately recovers a semantically matching
equation for 97.53% of the models. For complex equations with more operations,
accuracy stays consistently over 94%. REMaQE executes in 0.25 seconds on

prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$ of full rank (that is ${\rm det}(\rho_{\rm

centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$ whose radius is $\beta:=2^{1-m/2}\lambda_{\rm
min}(\rho_{\rm prod})$. Here, $\lambda_{\rm min}(\rho_{\rm prod})$ is the
smallest eigenvalue of $\rho_{\rm prod}$. We are assuming that the total
Hilbert space is finite dimensional and we use the notion of distance induced
by the Frobenius norm. Applying a scaling relation, we also give a new and
simple sufficient criterion for multipartite separability based on trace: ${\rm
Tr}[\rho\rho_{\rm prod}]^2/{\rm Tr}[\rho^2]\geq {\rm Tr}[\rho_{\rm

improve themselves by thinking and memory, without external resources. In this

the framework is divided into two stages: 1. before the test stage, we let the
LLM pre-think on the unlabeled dataset and save the high-confidence thoughts as
external memory; 2. during inference, given a test question, we let the LLM
recall relevant memory to help itself reason and answer it. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework can help ChatGPT significantly improve
its abilities in math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, factual reasoning and

that does not necessarily require quadrature exactness assumptions. Instead of
certain exactness degrees, we employ a restricted isometry relation based on
the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund system of quadrature rules to quantify the
quadrature error of polynomial integrands. The new method imposes only some
conditions on the polynomial degree of numerical solutions to derive the
maximum principle and energy stability, and thus, differs substantially from
existing methods in the literature that often rely on strict conditions on the
time stepping size, Lipschitz property of the nonlinear term, or $L^{\infty}$
boundedness of numerical solutions. Moreover, the new method is suitable for
long-time simulations because the time stepping size is independent of the
diffusion coefficient in the equation. Inspired by the effective maximum
principle recently proposed by Li (Ann. Appl. Math., 37(2): 131--290, 2021), we
develop an almost sharp maximum principle that allows controllable deviation of
numerical solutions from the sharp bound. Further, we show that the new method
is energy stable and equivalent to the Galerkin method if the quadrature rule
exhibits sufficient exactness degrees. In addition, we propose an energy-stable
mixed-quadrature scheme which works well even with randomly sampled initial
condition data. We validate the theoretical results about the energy stability
and the almost sharp maximum principle by numerical experiments on the 2-sphere
$\mathbb{S}^2$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04820v1

significant potential in improving learning outcomes at large scale. A key part
of automated feedback systems is an error classification component, which
identifies student errors and enables appropriate, predefined feedback to be
deployed. Most existing approaches to error classification use a rule-based
method, which has limited capacity to generalize. Existing data-driven methods
avoid these limitations but specifically require mathematical expressions in
student responses to be parsed into syntax trees. This requirement is itself a
limitation, since student responses are not always syntactically valid and
cannot be converted into trees. In this work, we introduce a flexible method
for error classification using pre-trained large language models. We
demonstrate that our method can outperform existing methods in algebra error
classification, and is able to classify a larger set of student responses.

raise two issues in MWP solving: 1) different output solutions for the same

that indicates wrong between the above examples. To address these issues, we
first introduce a unified tree structure to present expression, where the

performance in various NLP tasks. To tackle multi-step reasoning tasks,
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting includes a few manually crafted
step-by-step reasoning demonstrations which enable LLMs to explicitly generate
reasoning steps and improve their reasoning task accuracy. To eliminate the
manual effort, Zero-shot-CoT concatenates the target problem statement with
""Let's think step by step"" as an input prompt to LLMs. Despite the success of
Zero-shot-CoT, it still suffers from three pitfalls: calculation errors,
missing-step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors. To address the
missing-step errors, we propose Plan-and-Solve (PS) Prompting. It consists of
two components: first, devising a plan to divide the entire task into smaller
subtasks, and then carrying out the subtasks according to the plan. To address
the calculation errors and improve the quality of generated reasoning steps, we
extend PS prompting with more detailed instructions and derive PS+ prompting.
We evaluate our proposed prompting strategy on ten datasets across three

zero-shot prompting consistently outperforms Zero-shot-CoT across all datasets

dependence and Holling type III functional response, with particular emphasis
on the dynamics close to extinction. By using Briot-Bouquet transformation we
transform the model into a system, where the extinction steady state is
represented by up to three distinct steady states, whose existence is
determined by the values of appropriate Lambert W functions. We investigate how
stability of extinction and coexistence steady states is affected by the rate
of predation, predator fecundity, and the parameter characterising the strength
of functional response. The results suggest that the extinction steady state
can be stable for sufficiently high predation rate and for sufficiently small
predator fecundity. Moreover, in certain parameter regimes, a stable extinction
steady state can coexist with a stable prey-only equilibrium or with a stable
coexistence equilibrium, and it is rather the initial conditions that determine
whether prey and predator populations will be maintained at some steady level,
or both of them will become extinct. Another possibility is for coexistence
steady state to be unstable, in which case sustained periodic oscillations
around it are observed. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the
behaviour for all dynamical regimes, and in each case a corresponding phase
plane of the transformed system is presented to show a correspondence with
stable and unstable extinction steady state.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04053v1

the pressure within the gas bubble is spatially uniform and satisfies an ideal
gas law, relating the pressure, density and temperature of the gas. The
temperature of the surrounding liquid is taken to be constant and the behavior
of the liquid pressure at infinity is prescribed to be constant or periodic in
time. In arXiv:2207.04079, for the case where the liquid pressure at infinity
is a positive constant, we proved the existence of a one-parameter manifold of
spherical equilibria, parameterized by the bubble mass, and further proved that
it is a nonlinearly and exponentially asymptotically stable center manifold.
  In the present article, we first refine the exponential time-decay estimates,
via a study of the linearized dynamics subject to the constraint of fixed mass.
We obtain, in particular, estimates for the exponential decay rate constant,
which highlight the interplay between the effects of thermal diffusivity and
the liquid viscosity.
  We then study the nonlinear radial dynamics of the bubble-fluid system
subject to a pressure field at infinity which is a small-amplitude and
time-periodic perturbation about a positive constant. We prove that nonlinearly
and exponentially asymptotically stable time-periodically pulsating solutions
of the nonlinear (asymptotic) model exist for all sufficiently small forcing
amplitudes. The existence of such states is formulated as a fixed point problem

approach in the position-space representation. This leads to a differential
equation perspective for teaching the material. However, we know that abstract
representation-independent approaches often work better with students, by
comparing student reactions to learning the series solution of the harmonic
oscillator versus the abstract operator method. Because one can teach all of
the solvable quantum problems using a similar abstract method, it brings up the
question, which is likely to lead to a better student understanding? In work at
Georgetown University and with edX, we have been teaching a class focused on an
operator-forward viewpoint, which we like to call operator mechanics. It
teaches quantum mechanics in a representation-independent fashion and allows
for most of the math to be algebraic, rather than based on differential
equations. It relies on four fundamental operator identities -- (i) the Leibniz
rule for commutators; (ii) the Hadamard lemma; (iii) the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula; and (iv) the exponential disentangling
identity. These identities allow one to solve eigenvalues, eigenstates and
wavefunctions for all analytically solvable problems (including some not often
included in undergraduate curricula, such as the Morse potential or the
Poschl-Teller potential). It also allows for more advanced concepts relevant
for quantum sensing, such as squeezed states, to be introduced in a simpler
format than is conventionally done. In this paper, we illustrate the three
approaches of matrix mechanics, wave mechanics, and operator mechanics, we show
how one organizes a class in this new format, we summarize the experiences we
have had with teaching quantum mechanics in this fashion and we describe how it

circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states, an exponential
improvement over the previously known bound. This bound is asymptotically tight
if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist.
  - Given an $n$-qubit pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ that has fidelity at
least $\tau$ with some stabilizer state, we give an algorithm that outputs a
succinct description of a stabilizer state that witnesses fidelity at least
$\tau - \varepsilon$. The algorithm uses $O(n/(\varepsilon^2\tau^4))$ samples

function not necessarily conserved in the whole phase space $T^*Q$ but when
restricted to a certain invariant subspace ${\cal W}\subseteq T^*Q$ it becomes
a Liouville first integral. For natural Hamiltonian systems, it is demonstrated
that such a function $\cal I$ allows us to construct a lower dimensional
Hamiltonian in $\cal W$. This symmetry reduction is intimately related with a
phenomenon beyond separation of variables and it is based on an adaptive
application of the classical results due to Lie and Liouville on integrability.

believe that such models will disrupt society and will result in a significant
change in the education system and information generation in the future. So
far, this belief is based on either colloquial evidence or benchmarks from the
owners of the models -- both lack scientific rigour.
  Objective: Through a large-scale study comparing human-written versus
ChatGPT-generated argumentative student essays, we systematically assess the
quality of the AI-generated content.
  Methods: A large corpus of essays was rated using standard criteria by a
large number of human experts (teachers). We augment the analysis with a
consideration of the linguistic characteristics of the generated essays.
  Results: Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT generates essays that are rated
higher for quality than human-written essays. The writing style of the AI
models exhibits linguistic characteristics that are different from those of the
human-written essays, e.g., it is characterized by fewer discourse and
epistemic markers, but more nominalizations and greater lexical diversity.
  Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrate that models like ChatGPT
outperform humans in generating argumentative essays. Since the technology is
readily available for anyone to use, educators must act immediately. We must
re-invent homework and develop teaching concepts that utilize these AI models
in the same way as math utilized the calculator: teach the general concepts

symplectic structure that establish the proper canonical extension of a
conventional Hamiltonian $H$ will be derived from a generalized formulation of
Hamilton's variational principle. The extended canonical transformation theory
then naturally permits transformations that also map the time scales of
original and destination system, while preserving the extended Hamiltonian
$H_{1}$, and hence the form of the canonical equations derived from $H_{1}$.
The Lorentz transformation, as well as time scaling transformations in

transformations in the symplectic extended phase space. Furthermore, the
generalized canonical transformation approach allows to directly map explicitly
time-dependent Hamiltonians into time-independent ones. An ``extended''

by matter that violates null energy conditions (NEC). Essentially such wormhole
will be characterised by a central throat with anisotropic matter lining the
throat that violates NEC. This in turn provides viable geometry for the
wormhole to sustain. In 2018, L. Herrera introduced a new classification for
spherically symmetric bodies called ``complexity factor"". It was proposed that
a spherically symmetric non trivial geometry can be classified as complex or
non-complex based on the nature of the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the
stress energy tensors with only homogeneous and isotropic matter distribution
leading to null complexity. Mathematically there was also another way of
obtaining zero complexity geometry. In this context since static traversable
wormhole by default is characterised by anisotropic and inhomogeneous matter
stress tensors, the question we answer is whether it is possible to obtain zero

of quantum computing and quantum communication systems. Among QECCs, stabilizer
codes, particularly graph codes, have attracted considerable attention due to
their unique properties and potential applications. Concatenated codes, which
combine multiple layers of quantum codes, offer a powerful technique for
achieving high levels of error correction with a relatively low resource
overhead. In this paper, we examine the concatenation of graph codes using the
powerful and versatile graphical language of ZX-calculus. We establish a
correspondence between the encoding map and ZX-diagrams, and provide a simple
proof of the equivalence between encoding maps in the Pauli X basis and the
graphic operation ""generalized local complementation"" (GLC) as previously
demonstrated in [J. Math. Phys. 52, 022201]. Our analysis reveals that the
resulting concatenated code remains a graph code only when the encoding qubits
of the same inner code are not directly connected. When they are directly
connected, additional Clifford operations are necessary to transform the
concatenated code into a graphcode, thus generalizing the results in [J. Math.

bases, including the examination of holographic codes as concatenated graph
codes. Our findings showcase the potential of ZX-calculus in advancing the

  Classic ranking optimization studies often treat ranking as a sorting problem
with the assumption that the best performance of ranking would be achieved if
we rank items according to their individual utility.
  Accordingly, considerable ranking metrics have been developed and
learning-to-rank algorithms that have been designed to optimize these simple
performance metrics have been widely used in modern IR systems.
  As applications evolve, however, people's need for information retrieval have
shifted from simply retrieving relevant documents to more advanced information
services that satisfy their complex working and entertainment needs.
  Thus, more complicated and user-centric objectives such as user satisfaction
and engagement have been adopted to evaluate modern IR systems today.
  Those objectives, unfortunately, are difficult to be optimized under existing
learning-to-rank frameworks as they are subject to great variance and
complicated structures that cannot be explicitly explained or formulated with
math equations like those simple performance metrics.
  This leads to the following research question -- how to optimize result
ranking for complex ranking metrics without knowing their internal structures?
  To address this question, we conduct formal analysis on the limitation of
existing ranking optimization techniques and describe three research tasks in
\textit{Metric-agnostic Ranking Optimization}.
  Through the discussion of potential solutions to these tasks, we hope to
encourage more people to look into the problem of ranking optimization in
complex search and recommendation scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08062v1

$$TI(G)=\sum\limits_{uv\in E(G)}I(d_{u},d_{v}),$$ where $I(x,y)>0$ is a
symmetric real function with $x\geq 1$ and $y\geq 1$, $d_{u}$ is the degree of

number $r(G_1, G_2)$ is the minimum number $n$ such that the complete graph
$K_n\longmapsto(G_1, G_2)$. In [Discrete Math. 312(2012)], Schelp formulated
the following question: for which graphs $H$ there is a constant $0<c<1$ such
that for any graph $G$ of order at least $r(H, H)$ with $\delta(G)>c|V(G)|$,
$G\longmapsto(H, H)$. In this paper, we prove that for any $m>n$, if $G$ is a
balanced bipartite graph of order $2(m+n-1)$ with
$\delta(G)>\frac{3}{4}(m+n-1)$, then $G\longmapsto(CM_m, CM_n)$, where $CM_i$
is a matching with $i$ edges contained in a connected component. By
Szem\'{e}redi's Regularity Lemma, using a similar idea as introduced by [J.

integer $N_0>0$ such that for any $N>N_0$ the following holds: Let
$\alpha_1>\alpha_2>0$ such that $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=1$. Let $G[X, Y]$ be a
balanced bipartite graph on $2(N-1)$ vertices with
$\delta(G)\geq(\frac{3}{4}+3\eta)(N-1)$. Then for each red-blue-edge-coloring
of $G$, either there exist red even cycles of each length in $\{4, 6, 8,
\ldots, (2-3\eta^2)\alpha_1N\}$, or there exist blue even cycles of each length
in $\{4, 6, 8, \ldots, (2-3\eta^2)\alpha_2N\}$. Furthermore, the bound
$\delta(G)\geq(\frac{3}{4}+3\eta)(N-1)$ is asymptotically tight. Previous
studies on Schelp's question on cycles are on diagonal case, we obtain an

Flato's ``deformation philosophy"", of which the main paradigms are the physics
revolutions from the beginning of the twentieth century, quantum mechanics (via
deformation quantization) and special relativity. On the basis of these facts
we describe two main directions by which symmetries of hadrons (strongly
interacting elementary particles) may ``emerge"" by deforming in some sense
(including quantization) the Anti de Sitter symmetry (AdS), itself a
deformation of the Poincare group of special relativity. The ultimate goal is
to base on fundamental principles the dynamics of strong interactions, which
originated half a century ago from empirically guessed ``internal"" symmetries.
After a rapid presentation of the physical (hadrons) and mathematical
(deformation theory) contexts, we review a possible explanation of photons as
composites of AdS singletons (in a way compatible with QED) and of leptons as
similar composites (massified by 5 Higgs, extending the electroweak model to 3
generations). Then we present a ``model generating"" multifaceted framework in
which AdS would be deformed and quantized (possibly at root of unity and/or in
manner not yet mathematically developed with noncommutative ``parameters"").
That would give (using deformations) a space-time origin to the ``internal""

conservative and non-conservative forms of PDEs in a well-balanced manner. The
developed schemes are capable of exactly preserving both the still-water and
moving-water equilibria. Compared with existing well-balanced methods, this new

objects in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In the online setting, the geometric objects arrive
one by one. Upon the arrival of an object, an online algorithm must maintain a
valid hitting set by making an irreversible decision, i.e., once a point is
added to the hitting set by the algorithm, it can not be deleted in the future.
The objective of the geometric hitting set problem is to find a hitting set of
the minimum cardinality. Even and Smorodinsky (Discret. Appl. Math., 2014)

Whether such an algorithm exists for unit squares remained open for a long

doctoral students working in the field of MRI. Conclusions: We have shown a
collection of games that can be used independently by high school students and
people with no imaging background; they could also be used as demonstration
tools in formal courses. Further assessment of their educational value through
longer term usage is needed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05582v1

gaps between consecutive zeros of the derivatives of Hardy's function $Z(t)$,
improving upon previous results of Conrey and Ghosh [J. London Math. Soc. 32
(1985), 193--202], and of the second named author [Acta Arith. 111 (2004),
125--140]. We also exhibit small distances between the zeros of $Z(t)$ and the
zeros of $Z^{(2k)}(t)$ for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$, in support of our numerical
observation that the zeros of $Z^{(k)}(t)$ and $Z^{(\ell)}(t)$, when $k$ and
$\ell$ have the same parity, seem to come in pairs which are very close to each
other. The latter result is obtained using the mollified discrete second moment
of the Riemann zeta-function.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05181v1
294,On the derivatives of Hardy's function $Z(t)$,2023-04-11 12:35:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05178v1,"Let $Z^{(k)}(t)$ be the $k$-th derivative of Hardy's $Z$-function. The
numerics seem to suggest that if $k$ and $\ell$ have the same parity, then the
zeros of $Z^{(k)}(t)$ and $Z^{(\ell)}(t)$ come in pairs which are very close to
each other. That is to say that $Z^{(k)}(t)Z^{(\ell)}(t)$ has constant sign for
the majority, if not almost all, of values $t$. In this paper we show that this
is true a positive proportion of times. We also study the sign of the product
of four derivatives of Hardy's function,
$Z^{(k)}(t)Z^{(\ell)}(t)Z^{(m)}(t)Z^{(n)}(t)$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05178v1

most effective educational interventions: personalized instruction.
Reinforcement learning could be a key tool to reduce the development cost and
improve the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring software that aims to provide
the right support, at the right time, to a student. Here we illustrate that
deep reinforcement learning can be used to provide adaptive pedagogical support
to students learning about the concept of volume in a narrative storyline
software. Using explainable artificial intelligence tools, we extracted
interpretable insights about the pedagogical policy learned and demonstrated
that the resulting policy had similar performance in a different student
population. Most importantly, in both studies, the reinforcement-learning
narrative system had the largest benefit for those students with the lowest
initial pretest scores, suggesting the opportunity for AI to adapt and provide
support for those most in need.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04933v2
297,Observability of Hypergraphs,2023-04-10 22:11:02+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04883v1,"In this paper we develop a framework to study observability for uniform
hypergraphs. Hypergraphs are generalizations of graphs in which edges may
connect any number of nodes, thereby representing multi-way relationships which
are ubiquitous in many real-world networks including neuroscience, social
networks, and bioinformatics. We define a canonical multilinear dynamical
system with linear outputs on uniform hypergraphs which captures such multi-way
interactions and results in a homogeneous polynomial system. We derive a
Kalman-rank-like condition for assessing the local weak observability of this
resulting system and propose techniques for its efficient computation. We also
propose a greedy heuristic to determine the minimum set of observable nodes,
and demonstrate our approach numerically on different hypergraph topologies,
and hypergraphs derived from an experimental biological dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04883v1
298,Heat kernel for reflected diffusion and extension property on uniform domains,2023-04-08 04:31:58+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03908v1,"We study reflected diffusion on uniform domains where the underlying space
admits a symmetric diffusion that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates.
A celebrated theorem of Jones (Acta Math. 1981) states that uniform domains in
Euclidean space are extension domains for Sobolev spaces. In this work, we
obtain a similar extension property for metric spaces equipped with a Dirichlet
form whose heat kernel satisfies a sub-Gaussian estimate. We introduce a
scale-invariant version of this extension property and apply it to show that
the reflected diffusion process on such a uniform domain inherits various
properties from the ambient space, such as Harnack inequalities, cutoff energy
inequality, and sub-Gaussian heat kernel bounds. In particular, our work
extends Neumann heat kernel estimates of Gyrya and Saloff-Coste (Ast\'erisque
2011) beyond the Gaussian space-time scaling. Furthermore, our estimates on the
extension operator imply that the energy measure of the boundary of a uniform
domain is always zero. This property of the energy measure is a broad
generalization of Hino's result (PTRF 2013) that proves the vanishing of the
energy measure on the outer square boundary of the standard Sierpi\'nski carpet
equipped with the self-similar Dirichlet form.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03908v1

$A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n^{\times}$, which has non-empty subset sums equally
distributed modulo $n$. Here, $\mathbb{Z}_n^{\times}$ denotes the set which
contains all the invertible elements of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$. In particular,
we prove that if $n=q$ is a power of an odd prime, then $A$ is a union of sets
of the form $\{ a\cdot(\pm2^i)\}$. Additionally, we count the number of subsets
of $\mathbb{Z}_q^{\times}$ with non-empty subset sums equally distributed
modulo $q$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14141v1
